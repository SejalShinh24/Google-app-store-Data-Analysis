com.moez.QKSMS,Shrirang Sant,Easy to use,5
com.moez.QKSMS,Rony,I think Indians can't make trully free and opensource software. The app has in app purchase and so I am unable to backup messages. I am really afraid of the data leakage as it is not free at all. I would not install it if Signal did not drop the support. And I am going to uninstall it now.,1
com.moez.QKSMS,Retr0,Why does this app require camer accesess? The type that forcfuly avoids battery optimization .,3
com.moez.QKSMS,Ashaful Islam,I love y ou,5
com.moez.QKSMS,Thomas Roberts,"Thought I would give this a try. Nice UI and customization. Then I noticed that the app hasn't been updated since 2021, appearing that the developer is doing nothing with it.",3
com.moez.QKSMS,Krispy Mac,So far so good... Easier to use and configure than the native app on my mobile.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,Peter J. Petropoulos,Awesome alternative to onboard text messaging apps.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,MMT,material you? plans?,4
com.moez.QKSMS,Google Gmail,Worst app ever. Won't let you add sender to contacts. Basic stuff guys. Get it right or don't publish.,1
com.moez.QKSMS,Gordon Freeman (Ravenfrost),I love the fact it blocks scammers with should i answer pairing but 1 star due to i can't send any photos even recropped ones fix this immediately!!!,1
com.moez.QKSMS,Spartakos9,Sometimes I want to delete all the posts in a long conversation except a few. There us no way to select all then de-select the ones I want to keep. The only option is to delete the entire conversation or manually select individual messages to delete them This can be very time consuming if there are a lot of them. Can you fix this?,4
com.moez.QKSMS,Pulkit Bhardwaj,Please update the app,5
com.moez.QKSMS,Roland Cleaver,Installed because Signal will no longer support SMS but QKSMS only allows restore in the paid version and didn't pick up on the Signal export. Uninstalled immediately to avoid stranded messages.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,"Lynda Huston, Adams","I am having an issue with this texting app. It's NOT delivering my text messages. This is a BIG PROBLEM since that is what the purpose of the app is. To deliver & receive text messages through our phone. The $2.99 for the whole time you use this messaging app. is ok, IF IT WORKED, to be able to schedule text messages to be DELIVERED. The gifi, background etc. are very nice.",2
com.moez.QKSMS,Frela Aldridge,Just ferfect just what I needed the app works great ðŸ‘ðŸ¾ no problems at all and does exactly what it says love ðŸ’• it just got it today,5
com.moez.QKSMS,A Google user,"Not bad but lacking a few things. The thing most important to me is, when you get a reply from a text you send, there's no time on that reply text. That needs fixing. I'll stay with this application for now,but if the time of all texts were there, I might stay permanently Thanks for your reply, I'm happy that I can tap to find the time. I've amended to 5 stars . Just gone back to using the app again. How private& secure is it? Who can read my messages?",5
com.moez.QKSMS,KMM Zaman,"Something is good, but there is no ""mark all as read"" option. For that, we have to read all messages one by one to mark all messages as read; this is very annoying. Also, there are many problems when I send an SMS to two or more numbers of the same contact. I have to send that type of message individually to a person who has more than one number. Group masseges are not sendable individually, so we cannot see the delivery report for every massege easily.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,Uranus Asstronaughty,"Deceptive Scam. Came installed on phone and after a couple of years started asking for money for something as simple as attaching a picture. Presumably free open source app, but really a scam.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,Damodhar Pachava,Usefull and simple to use,5
com.moez.QKSMS,Andy Morrill,Easily the best looking and feature rich SMS app to replace your phones stock app. Highly recommend paying for the plus version of the app to support the devs.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,R S,"Works well for the .ost part have the contribution paid. I believe that app is not blocking internet texts although tied into call control & looks like they fixed so far, but 15 digit & ir 14 digit & 1 letter mainly out of country texts are an issue should be works on from this end as well.",4
com.moez.QKSMS,Yo Wein,doesn't seem to block any spam texts . numbers that I blocked the other day texted today? the app that came with my phone did a better job.,1
com.moez.QKSMS,Absolute13thDegreeMaster,Probably 1 of The Best Sms Apps from Play considering Tried others which were not Preferential compared QK! Just dam good App!!!!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,Dan Dippolito,Says it was open source a year ago. Now it has premium options you need to pay for. What's so open source about that? Very misleading. Google main messaging app let's u delay messages for free and create back-ups.... this is ridiculous. This seemed like the dream app for us geeks... now all u wanna do is make money for basic features... especially bc it used to be open source from what I read....,3
com.moez.QKSMS,Julieanne Patmore,Great app with streamlined design. Recommended!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,Misty Combs,Live this app! It has opened my eyes!!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,K,"Works fairly well, and privacy is better than a lot of other SMS services. Main drawbacks are that sending regular sized gifs are impossible and sending photos is difficult since the preview is so tiny. Best replacement for signal I could find",4

com.moez.QKSMS,Patrice Cooper,"Now with the update on this stupid app, not only is it NOT working properly, but when I try to put a message in draft, IT DISAPPEARS!! Y'all need to fix this mess, because yes, I like the app, but if it's going to constantly act like this, I will uninstall it-I'm contacting y'all again!",2
com.moez.QKSMS,Yvonne Price,Can't complain it's a really good app,5
com.moez.QKSMS,Blang Jango,"Seems decent overall in the last two weeks or so that I've been using it but have experienced missing received texts multiple times from both single users and in group conversations, with no indication.

com.moez.QKSMS,EarForceOne,"Just innstalled and so fsr so good. Way better and customizable than google native app! Lights out dark , simple customization for each contact and no annoying coloured circles.

com.moez.QKSMS,MJ Poppe,"Edit: 02/08/2023... This app appears to have been abandoned. Issues sending MMS, also issues with selecting contact to message. I previously mentioned notification issues, but I was able to resolve it as I work in IT. The way issues are appearing is likely from updates to android. This hasn't been updated since 2/7/2021. I've always liked the app, but with no updates, and the Dev wanting a screenshot of an issue that doesn't display an error code. I'm probably moving on.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,Jam Say,"Do Not Install. The developer says, ""things might break at 1MB"" in reference to sending a photo. I'm Uninstalling and can't recommend this app for that reason.",1
com.moez.QKSMS,Nilanko Halder,Doesn't provide the basic functionality of deleting blocked messages automatically. What is the point of blocking then if we can still see blocked messages? I wanted protection from harrassment but this app fails at it miserably.,1

com.moez.QKSMS,Peter M,Very basic and you need to pay for scheduling texts. No private inbox.,2
com.moez.QKSMS,Dan L,"Even when set as the default SMS app, messages are coming through messaging instead of QKSMS. That's literally the point of having a different messaging app is to not use the default app, so this has already failed at basic functionally.",1

com.moez.QKSMS,Austin Danisher,"Great experience so far! There wasn't anything wrong with Google Messages that I was using before but I sought something new and the clean interface, easy to use and customize features as well as highly functional QKSMS was a welcome alternative. Some features you get in Google Messages that you need to pay for in QKSMS like scheduled sending and such but the app looks promising and was an affordable *one time* purchase. Moreover, the unpaid version isn't handicapped or littered with ads.",5

com.moez.QKSMS,Pseudo Syne,"The data firm Amplitude operates through QKSMS to collect all kinds of data. You say you don't share data with third parties, but data gets sent to Amplitude. Seems dishonest. The app itself is easy on the eyes. It has customizable color schemes and allows for delayed send. Would be a decent app if not for selling data.

com.moez.QKSMS,Timothy Lawrence,"This is now my go-to SMS app. To quickly answer the question if this is still developed the answer is YES. You can find that info on the Github page from the creator. Aside from that this app has great customization, an excellent backup system and all the quick reply/mark as read tools I use. It does not support RCS but that is to be expected since Google is running that out of their own servers. BUT if you just need a great and transparent open source SMS app this is the one to use.

com.moez.QKSMS,meshingo dh,Exceptional,5
com.moez.QKSMS,Al Pray,Excellent app. I have overcome the issues other people reported with images by specifying MMS messages and increasing the compression size in the settings. The app is very customizable and it also includes the ability to archive messages. It's also the only text app that I found so far that has an option to have texts turn the screen on when the screen is dark see you can see the text without having to touch your phone.,5

com.moez.QKSMS,Prashant Mahale,Great App overall. In terms of experience and customisability. Only issue I face is that when I delete latest messages from thread the screen scrolls to where the thread last message is. So I end up requiring to scroll back to the top which does not seem right.,5
com.moez.QKSMS,Antoni Thel,Google and Samsung messaging haven't been sending my messages. Either connected to Wi-Fi or even full bars of 5g. This app has finally been sending my messages consistently. Thanks tons guys!,5
com.moez.QKSMS,Steve Atkinson,Tried this app because Samsung messenger's speech to text is terrible. This app's speech to text work quite well. The problem is that QKSMS's ability to send quality pictures as attachments is very bad. I don't why. I switched back to messenger and the very same pictures sent and received with the same quality as the camera took. Also I don't like paying for things that other apps offer fir free. Like message scheduling. For now I've gone back to messenger.,3
com.moez.QKSMS,Alex de Moura,SHARE!!!! NOT SHARING?? Can't share messages like any other common plain regular simple bundled SMS app? SHARE!!! SHARE!!! Most basic feature of any app on any device connected or not to the Internet. SHARE!! SHARE!! SHARE!! What is the point of resources usage in: Inbox (date/time sorted only); Archive (unsorted); Blocked Messages (unsorted); if their content can't be sent to any other app (in case we're lucky to find the content). SHARE! SHARE! SHARE! SHARE! SHAAAAAAAAARRREEEEEEEE!!!,2
com.moez.QKSMS,Sharee Johnson,App is good so far but I need to be able to do group messages and select multiple ppl at one time not how y'all have it were I can add a person from another person's chat and then do it again and again...

com.moez.QKSMS,Mopar Man,Ever since I paid for the all access features this app has really gone downhill. Every time I try to send a picture or a screenshot it fails to send and tells me to try again - it never works. I never had problems before sending photos or screenshots via text. This is a pretty useless texting app if you can't send screenshots or pictures. The only time I can now send a picture is if I reduce the resolution so far that the pic becomes almost unviewable.

com.moez.QKSMS,Jeff Ishmael,This app I was forced to download from another app for it to work. This app does not work. It does not stop SMS messaging like I thought it would. An example is my name is totally different than the name in the message. If there is a way to make it work I'm willing to try it again. Until then I am uninstalling the app.,1
com.moez.QKSMS,Deloris,Love this app..,5
com.moez.QKSMS,David Bond Engelhard,I like it better the Google app. Best texting app I've tried so far. Does anyone know of an app that has amazing spell check. I can't find one.

I switch to auto compression or no compression where the pictures still look great but they won't send. Hopefully it will be fixed soon.,4

I would delete messenger but it's one of those built in apps and even though it's and unlocked phone it won't let me delete messenger.

One gripe and one question. Wish it had 1second as a delayed sending option.

However, I found out that you can only schedule one SMS once off, there is no repeat function.
