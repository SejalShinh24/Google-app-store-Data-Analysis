com.textra,Douglas Calkins,Forcing you to use the app as your default literally defeats the purpose of having a separate way of texting and a second number. Ridiculous,1
com.textra,Daniel deCavaignac,"I would love the ability to restrict searches to just the thread address (not all the text). Also I need a way to delete threads, not just hide them, so they don't appear in search results.",4
com.textra,Calvin Tyson,I wanted to send group texts and have the replies come to me. This app does that and more. Being able to color code my contacts adds a nice touch too.,4
com.textra,Tess Cook,"I've been using this app for as long as I've had a dmart phone. The way it makes my messages look just is much cleaner and more satusfying than how the preinstalled messenger app looks. Great for group messaging, which is something I couldn't find on any other app. Really love the layout of all of it. It's nice because it doesn't haggle you for upgrade fees like go sms or others",5
com.textra,Michelle Arlene,"So far, so good! I had been using the pre-installed Google Messenger for years with no problem, but all of a sudden messages I sent weren't being being received by friends although I was getting messages they sent to me. I tried several other messaging apps, but the same thing was happening. I had a flash of inspiration and disabled Google Messenger. That worked, and my outgoing messages are being received. I decided to stay with this one because it seems to have the best features.",5
com.textra,Stuart Beasley,Works Great,5
com.textra,Maurice Milligan,"This is easy to use, clear and well-engineered. Just simple and efficient. Why can't more apps be like this?",5
com.textra,Jen Gee (Jen),I love this app but recently upgraded my phone and now it seems to be acting very strangely. I either receive the same picture 3x (and once I received one 29x!) from a contact. I also have a lot of trouble sending short videos. I might have to switch apps :(,3
com.textra,Trish T,Great features but the one I want doesn't work regularly. Bitmoji and other mood emotions avatars created by me load and disappear and do not appear in my text. I use these for mood rather than texting words. Too bad! Deleting today.,3
com.textra,Martin Noe,"I've used Textra for a long time. Let me tell you there's nothing out there that can beat this app, and I've tried them all. However, because my eyes are very sensitive to light, I'm forced to turn on the ""Force Dark Mode"" in Developer Options for those apps that don't offer dark mode on their own. When I do that, the colors on Textra become very skewed, light color text on light colored backgrounds. Textra simply does not work properly in that mode, and I can't use it. I hope you can fix it.",4
com.textra,Cousin Benson,"It has a fundamental flaw which the developers do not seem bothered about fixing. No default setting for which sim card to send messages from and so I inadvertently sent some from my Pay As You Go second sim and was charged. If you want to charge Â£4.49 for the upgraded app, make sure it is absolutely flawless and if people highlight aspects then make them better. When going into groups the contacts are not displayed alphabetically. 3 years llater and still not addressed the default sim flaw!",1
com.textra,Brittany Johnson,So far I like it but the whole reason I got this app was bc I seen a video that said i would be able to customize individual contact's text notification sounds but I haven't been able to figure out how to yet. But if I do I'll be sure to do an update..,3
com.textra,J L R,"I had heard good things about Textra, but the amount of texts I never received is actually having a pretty significant impact on my life so I need to find something else. I'm also not super impressed with the fact that I need to have mobile data on to send a photo.",2
com.textra,Scream.X,1 tiny ad a few times a week at the top. Don't even notice 1/2 the time.,5
com.textra,Arjun Singh,Very useful and stable,5
com.textra,Jon Rickell,"I love this app, but since moving to TMobile lately I cannot send texts to Verizon users. Unfortunately, if I can't depend on the message getting to who it needs to get to I can't use the app. Maybe I'm doing something wrong ðŸ˜ž EDIT: It was just me doing something wrong, thank you so much for the help!",5
com.textra,Jay K,"I have tried several other texting apps. This is the one for me. But I do admit that I use encrypted texting apps, Signal and Whatsapp.",5
com.textra,John Goncalves,"I've been using textra for a while, really like it, does everything and more, quite a few options, highly recommended. A lot of options.",5
com.textra,Tony Ruiz,"It's very good, but I wish it would allow more than one signature.",4
com.textra,b L,"Loved this app, until it began having problems not allowing messages to open and at times my texts weren't rcvd. They state it is from a problem within my cell service provider. Funny how it worked for so long with no problems. Maybe due to their constant updating of the app is when things went south.",1
com.textra,JD Morse,"Update 3/22/23 after dev responded. Thanks dev, that worked for keeping my message as unread. However, I still have this one original complaint. So far my only complaint is that you can't mark the message read from the notification.",4

com.textra,Hector V,This is an Awesome texting app!!!,5
com.textra,Sam Us,"This app is great for texting, love it and have used it every day for years across multiple phones. The support team is also really responsive if there are any rare issues or in one case when I suggested a feature and not long later they implemented it! Definitely recommend.",5
com.textra,Chris Gullett,does not send pictures very well,3
com.textra,Marybeth Martin,Textra is great!! The messaging is customizable in so many ways that make it a million times more versatile than a stock messaging app. I love the background color choices and the font styles and sizes. I love this app!!!,5
com.textra,A Google user,"This is still a great app. However, I have moved on to other apps that allow archiving of old messages. If you will bring this function to this app, I will be back.",3
com.textra,Faith Wright,"Love it and I've tried several messaging apps. I've been an avid GO SMS PRO user for years and this tops even that app! Suggestion: Please make a pop up chat head when you get a message. And the option to customize the ringtones for each contact. Also, customizable contact backgrounds. Then it will be the perfect app. Most messaging apps have those features. They're all quite helpful. Thanks for an amazing app! ðŸ˜Š",5
com.textra,Andy Goodwin,brilliant app,5
com.textra,BBLI PRINCESS,Love this app. I'm able to have different notifications for my contacts. Very user friendly. Great features. I noticed when I try to send a gif it goes away and an exclamation comes up. How do I fix that?,4
com.textra,SLP,"I can't get an audible notification anymore, I did switch to Google Pixel 7 Pro, so I don't know if that matters. Additionally all of the text messages from any person are separate (individual) messages when I search for a contact in Textra. This is a change, messy and very annoying. Otherwise great app, I've used for years.",3
com.textra,Kenneth Robbins,one of the best texting apps available,4
com.textra,Smash Bridges,"8 years later, several phones, no complaints. Have encouraged several friends to join me here. Very happy. Could not be happier with this app. Finally decided I had enough of Go and the ads, bad emojis, poor backup...started using Textra and I've found my new favorite messing app! Customizable, iOS emojis, colors, and works spectacularly!",5

com.textra,Shawna Huff,Pictures & media won't send or either take a long time to send since the last update.,3
com.textra,Cass,Was loving this app. Had upgraded to pro. But can not send pictures/gifs/emojis. They disappear if I try writing any text next to them. In my business I need to send product pictures but have to resort to social media apps instead.,3
com.textra,Mrbacon60,"Best texting app I've ever had, customer service got back to me same day",5
com.textra,Mike Parker,"New update is a struggle. Can't send MMS texts when attached to wifi for some reason. Pics, group chats ect. Have to disconnect from wifi to send. Very annoying",1
com.textra,Jason Florence,Is Textra sms encrypted?,3

com.textra,Aaron,Absolutely love it! So many options.,5
com.textra,Jon Harrison,I love Textra over my phone's standard SMS app because of the extra features. One of my favorites is the app's color options.,5
com.textra,Bee,I've been using Textra for years. Looks like my old review was from 2018 and I loved it even then when it still had things it needed to function a specific way. I purchased the ad free version almost immediately after downloading it. I'll never go back to a normal messaging app again. I'm a Textra girl for life!,5
com.textra,Jae D.,Great app! Easy to use.,5

com.textra,Rose G,"I like some of the features of this app such as being able to change the colors for individuals, the delete functions and more. It's simple to use and fun. As of August 2022 I am still using Textra. I find it is the best for me. They keep improving it and adding more features. It's still simple and very user friendly. I've made mine very pretty colors. 3/21/2023 I continue to use this app and love it. It's visually pleasing and the appearance is easily modified to your liking. So nice!",5

com.textra,Lloyd (blknite55),"Since last update, I keep getting an error message when trying to send a text.

com.textra,katy winter,"Awesome app - my original review was 2018, and it's 2023, so been using it exclusively for five years. Love using it as it's much better than the default for Samsung, and wouldn't go to anything else. Love the colour coding, love the delay send send function, and all the custom notification symbols so I can see easily if important people have messaged.",5
com.textra,Bob Foster,"Love this app, keeps getting better.",5
com.textra,Anthony Lincoln (Ooda),I love it. Simple to use. Easy to navigate through if I need to change colors or customize threads. Update: why was the change put where I can't send a voice message via text? Update back to 5 stars. Thanks for your help,5
com.textra,Edwin Jackson,"Great app, adds features that should have been in the stock application. Keeps getting better. Been using it for years.",5

com.textra,Arick Hauschild,"This has been my default SMS app for 8 years! I love all the customization features and how I no longer have that ""xyz liked the message"" app in texts with iOS users. I originally got this app because my native SMS app didn't support group chats very well, and I've been happy with it every since. The couple of times I've reached out to tech support for an issue they were quick to respond with a resolution for me. Great app!",5
com.textra,Jon H,"4.60 completely broke on my phone, constantly force closed, I had to download 4.56 from a website.. Pain in the butt backing up all your messages and calls history in case something goes wrong.. Now there's 4.61 and what does the changelog say.. ""Some bug fixes"", not ""addressed this issue or that issue"".. Nope let's be as vague as possible. Think I'll skip 4.61 and wait for a version that actually has a changelog. Are there any other good sms apps out there?",4

com.textra,SubjectTea9 2,"I absolutely love Textra. Just one request: Developer, could you please make it so I can give custom names to group chats? For example, I could name one ""Work Chat"", another one ""School Chat"", etc. Thank you so much! Textra is honestly the most beautiful and wonderful texting app I've ever had the pleasure of using on Android. I bought premium because it was worth it. Default messaging apps are way behind Textra, Textra is so much nicer! Thanks. May God bless. Jesus Christ loves you! Take care.",5

com.textra,John Jensen,An excellent app that gets updated periodically. the ability to change things to fit my liking is especially a plus. I wish it would allow me to send videos,5
com.textra,Darcy Moore,"Excellent customisation options. A pleasure to use. One annoyance, which had been raised for years now, is in relation to the scheduling feature. There is no ""recurring"" option. This option has certainly been available in other message apps I've used.",4
com.textra,YM 23az,"Recently can't see or access Textra text msgs with the Textra app on my Samsung Phone. It is automatically direct to Google Play. Have to log in Google Play in order to access Textra, then open app to see text msg. This never happened before and is occurring frequently. It feels that this app is collecting some kind of info or monitoring the text msg. If this happens again, will be looking for another text msg app.",2
com.textra,Alex Fernandez,"Still the best msg app out there. One downside thing it's been doing lately is whenever a new message is received, the badge app icon will show (4) new messages and it's actually only (1). And it does it for every message. It will show (8) if it's actually only (2) messages and so forth. So that's annoying. But otherwise, it's a reliable app.",4
com.textra,Chris Doehring,Good for the most part. Only issue is receiving texts and some dont notify without opening the app. I have a samsung s22+ but this has happened wirh every samsung Ive had. Update: never contacted so thats on me. Newest update caused contacts to start new conversations and old conversations are no longer attainable without a search. So essentially new conversations.,4

com.textra,Kevin Spears,"Like the customization options and app, but one issue: The quick reply notification keeps coming up when phone has restarted and seems at regular intervals through the day when this option has been turbed off in system notification settings. This is being changed without my input to tell it to do so, more a personal annoyance than anything major, would like the devs to investigate android 11 on a moto one 5g ace phone for reference. And Delicious, mine still had that on, off now let's see. Thks",5

com.textra,Cal Desmond-Pearson,"Brilliant app! Best on the market! I've even bought the Pro version (a rare occurrence for a parsimonious creature like me ðŸ˜ƒ) Only issue I have, and that's not the fault of the Textra Devs, rather it's fault of Android. It's just that every morning when phone wakes up I have to reset Textra as default instead of Messages! I've tried every way I know of to stop Messages taking over ðŸ¤¬ . Only permanent solution I can think of is Rooting my phone (not a fun-packed process! ðŸ˜±)",5

I didn't make any change or selected those. I was using the old yellow ones because who cares what color your tiny avatars are. It's great the option exists. It's not great to have it shoved in your face without consent. EDIT: To the dev response, given that it's buried under 3 menus, its obviously a very deliberate action.

com.textra,Kaushal Jain,There are some features that are missing 1. Sms received on which sim should be shown on notification panel itself. Currently only sms content and time is shown. This feature would be very handy to get hold of information. 2. There should be option to fix certain chat window to top. I know pin option is there but if we have more than 2 pin chats then within that it arranges the windows by using time it received. We should be given option to choose the sorting.

The 'contact' favorites idea is not useful if your contacts are listed with home/work/mobile #s because all three show up when only the mobile # is relevant.

I have to use my phones built-in text messaging app just to send a simple text. This is a Galaxy S8 phone. Please fix ASAP. Thank You.,3
com.textra,Josh Sutterfield,"They clickjack to sell ads (update: worse now). App is decent, but it's lame to click a text and have an add slip under your thumb. Update: The clickjacking has worsened. The Ad Position solution is no longer honored. Ads appear randomly in any position in the text history looking just like texts. Ad creep just keeps creeping. Policy shifts, old standards are forgotten. Getting the paid version isn't a bad idea. Just sad to see it happen this way.",2
com.textra,Gerald Markowitz,"I have been using the pay version of Textra for quite some time. Some features that are helpful: 1. You canâ€™t send a text to a contact without the contactâ€™s phone number being identified as a MOBILE number. So, you canâ€™t accidentally send a text message to a land line. 2. Their support is excellent. Every question or issue I have had with my phone is answered almost immediately. 3. There are several customizations in the settings that let you have the display of messages the way you want it",4

Not being able to add or remove a contact to an existing conversation. People have been complaining about this for years. So it is not new. Apparently Textra developers don't want to or don't know how to do it. Either way they should explain why they aren't adding it. It shouldn't be that hard since other text message apps provide it.

com.textra,Andy Parsons,great SMS/MMS app. Definitely provides more detailed info than the default android messages app. built in ability to split long messages into separate texts and has a character counter which is really handy. very happy with this app and will be continuing to use it.,5
com.textra,GARLAND WHITE,Great app and support is awesome. I won't mention names but the lady I spoke with is amazing,5
com.textra,bob watson,I've downgraded to one star mostly because of the incompetence of the support team. Absolutely useless! I recently updated to 4.6 but the what's new link didn't tell me anything. I asked the support team and they just give me the run around with no information on what's new with this update. Very frustrating! Unfortunately this is the way this company works. And this was an automatic update which is unusual. I don't appreciate the update being forced on me.,1
com.textra,Big M25,"This is a great sms app, actually can even say it's better than Message+ from Verizon in customization. How ever, I feel $7 is a bit to much just to remove a small banner off the app. Maybe if Textra Pro had additional features I would pay, but just to remove a banner it's not worth the price. Good job on the app itself overall!! Looking forward to using this app for a great while.",4
com.textra,Josiah Torgerson,"An incredible app! There is not a feature I've wanted that this app doesn't have, and many that only this app has. Contact vibration patterns, colors, even ad placement on your conversation list, you can customize everything. 10/10, would download free again",5

com.textra,Joe LaValley,i have had it for about a month. the customization of my conversations is really nice. Textra is super easy to use. well developed. have referred several friends to check it out. ads in this free version are surprisingly minimal. Not a bother. again great development that does not ostracize their users. I missed one thing though here. A smallish thing. The app will show a dot that means i have a message when i dont or have already seen the msg. and it just doesnt register that.,4

com.textra,Frankie,I have been a Textra user for years and I have loved that this whole time but now that I have a Samsung ultra s22; now randomly when I try to send thru Textra this this app does not work.

com.textra,Michael Hahn,Good messaging app but with a few problems which keep me from giving it four stars: 1) You can't just type a message and attach photos. the message goes thru but no photos. I have to send photos without text separately. 2) switched to this after reading I could send an entire conversation to another person. when you do the photos don't send and the sending of a conversation goes to the recipient as a single message and not separate. Also I wish the conversation was encrypted. Great Support!!,4

Something I really like is the developer takes suggestions to heart and they work to improve the app. Also, if you have a support question, they typically answer within the same day... And, they provide solutions! My only gripe is that blocklist needs improvement... There is no multi-select or ""sort by"" option. You can delete numbers one-at-a-time, or delete the whole list. Accidentally blocked #'s are hard to find as your list grows. 5 STARS IF FIXED!",4

I like the color options. Could use an option to add a background pic but I have no complaints. Mms configuration is simple as long as you know your providers mms settings. Would definitely recommend.",4
com.textra,Papatii Shoemake,"Textra is the ONLY texting app our entire household uses! We've tried many others over the years but we go RIGHT BACK to Textra! We love the way it can be customized to fit each persons preference. We love the color & theme, the quick response, choice of MANY emoji packs, font sizes, the ability to like or respond with an emojicon, the blocklist, ability to share to email, SO many things to LOVE about Textra!

com.textra,Ryan,"Overall, it's a great app... very reliable and easy to use! Lots of things I love about it... and if you're going to use it, get the paid version! It's not much by any means, it supports the developer so they can continue to work on it and improve it and it lets you unlock the full experience of the app! For the downfalls, very plain looking... boring look compared to other texting apps. Can change colors but no themes, layouts! No deleted folder to recover accidentally deleted texts either!",4

Not only can u change the app icon color but you can customize overall theme and even each conversation. Hundreds of colors, seven different style text boxes and multiple emoji styles including apple and twitter. Theres a concient ""keep"" button where you can store info for future use.

However, I can only give it 4â˜† for one main reason: when I block a number/email (usually spam) and haven't opened the message, I still get a notification for the unread message. It's really annoying. I feel like if I go through the process of blacklisting a contact, any unread messages by them should automatically be marked as read so as to not trigger the notifications.

If Bob sends me a text saying - hey (insert pet name here.) let's chat. I would like to not receive that whole text. But I also don't want any future texts to be blocked, unless it has that word I blocked from that person. So if let's say Sam texted me (insert pet name here.) I would still get Sam's texts.
