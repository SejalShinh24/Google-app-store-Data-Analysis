    "V. Comparison between the polarity tables\n",
    "Analyzing the polarity tables from Textblob and Vader, it can be seen that the scores calculated by both the libraries are mostly similar. \n",
    "The similarities and differences can be observed from the differences between the numbers of the corresponding reviews. \n",
    "Similarity:\n",
    "For example: review 1 has polarity 0.4333 by Textblob and 0.4404 by Vader which is almost similar, review 4 has polarity 0.5000 by Textblob and 0.6369 by Vader which is almost similar. \n",
    "Difference:\n",
    "There are slight variations which can be observed, as in the case of review 999 where Textblob has calcuated a polarity of 0, that is neutral while Vader calculated it as -0.3421. The differences are due to the way these 2 libraries calculate the sentiment of the reviews. \n",
    "Therefore, the overall comparison between the 2 libraries depends on the review being analyzed. Vader handles individual words and expressions and also takes into consideration emojies, punctuations and capitalization but as all of these have already been removed during the preprocessing, so, it is not really beneficial in our context. In our case, Textblob might be a better option because it calculates the overall sentiment of the sentence. "

    "For example: review 0 has polarity -0.166667 by Textblob and -0.6369 by Vader which is significantly different. It can be observed that Vader is more negative than Textblob. The differences are due to the way these 2 libraries calculate the sentiment of the reviews. \n",
    "Therefore, the overall comparison between the 2 libraries depends on the review being analyzed. Vader handles individual words and expressions and also takes into consideration emojies, punctuations and capitalization but as all of these have already been removed during the preprocessing, it is not really beneficial in our context. In our case, Textblob might be a better option because it calculates the overall sentiment of the sentence."

    "V. Comparison between the polarity tables \n",
    "Analyzing the polarity tables from Textblob and Vader, it can be seen that the scores calculated by both the libraries are mostly similar. \n",
    "The similarities and differences can be observed from the differences between the numbers of the corresponding reviews. Similarity: \n",
    "For example: review 0 has polarity 0.5 by Textblob and 0.4404 by Vader which is almost similar and shows that both the reviews are positive. Review 1 has polarity 0.174242 by Textblob and 0.2023 by Vader which is again similar. \n",
    "Difference: \n",
    "For example: review 998 has polarity -0.166667 by Textblob and 0.0258 by Vader which is significantly different. Textblob has given a negative polarity which indicates a negative review while Vader has given a positive review which shows a positive review about the app. The differences are due to the way these 2 libraries calculate the sentiment of the reviews. \n",
    "Therefore, the overall comparison between the 2 libraries depends on the review being analyzed. Vader handles individual words and expressions and also takes into consideration emojies, punctuations and capitalization but as all of these have already been removed during the preprocessing, so, it is not really beneficial in our case. In our case, Textblob might be a better option because it calculates the overall sentiment of the sentence."

    "IV. As Google apps had a lot of reviews, it was really beneficial to do the data analysis as we had a lot of information. But we were supposed to filter only 1000 reviews for topic modelling. So, I chose the 1000 most recent reviews as with the passage of time, the reviews become irrelevant. So, the size of the data was moderate for initial analysis and we can change it further if needed. Choosing 10 topics out of the 1000 reviews have resulted in a broad variety of topics. If I need to improve the results, I will need to increase the number of reviews to analyse or the number of topics to extract as a starting point for further analysis. Moreover, if we increase the number of reviews for performing the topic modelling, it might lead to capturing fake and spam reviews which will add noise to the topics obtained and might lead to inaccurate results. So, it is a matter of tuning the parameters to get the best possible results. Therefore, the accuracy of the model is dependent on various parameters. "
