xyz.klinker.messenger,Mary Buchanan,"Since new update, app doesn't show new messages when you open the app. It notifies you there is a message, but the new messages are not at the top of the list. Even when you scroll down the list, it doesn't show the new messages.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Kim Lyons,Everything was great for the past 3 years with pulse until this current update! Now I'm not receiving my text...random pics are sending by themselves and some more... fix this issue!,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Travis Quiring,I have been using this app for a few years and this last few days my messages are no longer being properly sorted. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling several time. Is there a solution to this?,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Tony Minsent,"Used to be great, but has gone downhill recently. Most recent update broke the message list. Convos no longer automatically update to the top of the list when you receive a text.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Thomas Johnson,love the pulse music app! very customizable. love the shuffle because it plays every song once. before you start over,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,William Rod,"Been using it for awhile with no issues, except now it seems like the new messages are no longer being pushed to the top of the list. Will go back to 5 stars once that is fixed.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Matt Witz,I tried this app out and canceled the same day it said it would not charge me. I was charged for a year subscription. I downloaded again today opened and canceled again for the second time. I took a screenshot of the cancelation this time.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Raham Sk,Mulchandsk,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Brad Wake,"I have had for years, and used to work fine until a recent update. Now, after sending a new message, the message does not move to the top of the list of messages. The messages remain in the previous order. I have tried removing and reinstalling the app. Still no good. I'll try it again in a few weeks, and see if it's corrected.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Adeeb Choudhury,Buggy after the last update. New texts are not highlighted or brought to the top of the message list. Have to hunt down & check all texts to see if a new message has come in.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,M G,No app for wear os so can't get messages on galaxy watch,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Naya S,"This used to be awesome, but then they put the scheduled messages behind a pay wall. This was the only reason I downloaded this app, so I will be finding a new one.",1

xyz.klinker.messenger,James Kelling,"Lately i get the notification that I get a message and it is nowhere to be found when I open the app, and only appears once I open the respective conversation. Message log screen doesn't update until I send a message back. Very annoying. Switching to a different messaging app until this is fixed.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Johan H,"I just noticed, the text messages in pulse are a) no longer sorted in date/time received order, and b) in the main list it no longer shows the most recent msg (either sent or received). I see there was (evidently) an update 2 days ago. It seems these issues have been recently introduced in the latest version?",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,S Davi,"I used Google Messages to begin with, but the spell checker didn't work on my tablet, so I tried MightyText and it worked great, but the cost was outrageous for essentially a spell checker. So I tried Pulse, and like Messages, no spell checker. Pulse said it was the keyboard app. I said if it was it wouldn't work in MightyText. Uninstall! My solution was getting a multi device keyboard and just switching to my phone to text, voila! No headaches, no expense! Could I get that refund you promised?",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mark K,"Just noticed that Maple bought this months ago. App is good, but not hanging around to see what garbage they are well known to add. Edit: Looked at reviews after not using this for 2 years. Appears I was right about Maple Media removing features for extra money.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,MARK D,"For a PAID app, it should be way easier to do a simple password reset. They instruct you to go to MY ACCOUNT, but there is nothing in any app menu that shows that. Also, the app will not send any GIFs. They appear in your own text view, but the recipients never see them.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,KBK,"After the update, the scheduled SMS feature has been limited per day, which causes inconvenience, now switched to Google SMS which has unlimited Scheduled SMS per day.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Rich,"Message delays are now limited to 10 a day and you want me to pay for unlimited usage? Yeah, I'm not going to succumb to your capitalistic nonsense. Just another company trying to create a subscription model. Screw you guys. Scheduled messages are free with Samsung messages and Textra. Send delay was the only reason I used this app, but now that I see I can use those features for free with Textra, I'll happily uninstall this app and i encourage others to do same. Uninstalled",1

xyz.klinker.messenger,Manuel M.,Mms issue. I can't receive any pictures or other by mms,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jonothan Hope,Most features work well but contacts that are on my phone don't show up. Makes it very frustrating to use.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Marc Schlesinger,Decent but greedy product. Went from $14.99 to $99.00 for a lifetime subscription.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Piyush singh 732 vloger,tis app is very intersting becuse veery halp fully gaget,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Lil Khap,Mariowilm,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Miss Tiffany Green,I researched to make sure customizing the background would be possible before subscribing for 1 year. Only to discover it actually isn't possible to add your own graphic to the text background.Very disappointing and going to cancel subscription.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,j storry,I liked it at first then it had issues and I gave up and went with another app,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Sharon Wong,"Yay! Finally, i found an sms app that is fast and has NO ads!! Ads are so annoying! ðŸ™„ Luv this! Does this have any disappearing messages option? Thank you!",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,J. Merdas,Started requiring subscription and payment for simple function as scheduled sms where all other sms apps such a simple function is for free,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Shafiq Abdo,"Last update the feature to make a special ring tone to private messages was removed, we wonder why?",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,"Heart To Heart With Heather B, LLC","Edit:(3-14-23) Zero stars. I can now only send ONE delayed msg/day. Delay msg was your best feature. Why remove it & try selling us an upgrade to +? That is stupid! ------- (2019) I am very easily satisfied. I bought a new phone and severely missed the ability to schedule messages. I searched high and low, to no avail. I found this app in the wee hours of the morning. I can once again schedule my msgs. Happiness!!!",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,John Smith,"Uninstalled. After using for sometime I was going to pay for this App, but subscription at $150AU per year, and the almost constant nag to upgrade, got tired of it and uninstalled. I have paid for many Apps, but I'm not going to be ripped off under the cloak of ""subscription"", same reason I no longer use photoshop. It's just a greedy way to get more out of you. As a suggestion, why not have a cut-down version that does not have cloud storage",1

xyz.klinker.messenger,Yo Kiry,limited send delays? how does it make sense to lock a previously free feature behind a pay wall unannounced?,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,A.J. Hernandez,"Update: I uninstalled this app. I got tired of people not receiving photos or videos. It's embarrassing when I can't send someone a photo or a document scan. The app started great but went downhill. Do not download this app, it's a waste of time. Old review: I really like this app and have been using it for years but recently people are not receiving any photos or gifs that I send them.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,James S,"Had an issue receiving messages and they were awesome! They found out the problem, legacy subscription, and upgraded me to the current one for free. It has great privacy features and great people running it.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,David Tucker,"Beautiful, simple design, nice features, and solid performance. Seamless backup - install on a new phone, login, and all texts and attachments are available. Nice PWA app allows accessing your Android phone's texts on an iPad.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Hergy,Works great even though I have no data plan which means I can not send MMS. Conversation archive feature and Blocklist feature is why I gave it 5 stars. Thanks for a great app,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Timura Blackee,Grt app u better install too,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Miss Tunes,"Pulse used to be a good texting app. Now it deletes the characters on my texts just out of nowhere, or completely shuts down. Pulse should include the feature where you see if when other person is typing, allow attachments to remain in scheduled msgs before you select it to become a scheduled msg, offer more fonts, emojis and an undue or Control Z feature, allow 3 seconds before sending and compete with Apple by offering an edit or delete after sending. You want 5 stars, then earn them!",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,N H,So now you're Pay walling the send delay feature. Something that was already an included feature. How scummy can you be? What a joke.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Scott Watkins,"Has all the features and customizations I'm looking for, well executed app! Edit: Dropped a star since scheduled messages are now limited to 1/day in the free version, also limits the number of delayed messages. Will be finding another app.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Alejandro Keller,Pay yo receive sms? Lol,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Lin Ace,The action notification is very useful. But buggy with bubbles. Need star or pin or lock a single message.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,R. D. S.,"NOT SURPRISED WHATS HAPPENED WITH THIS APP. THE PREVIOUS OWNER RAN THE APP RIGHT AND IT WAS OPEN SOURCE. MAPLE MEDIA BUYS AN APP AND RUINS IT. THAT IS PRECISELY WHATS HAPPENED HERE SINCE IT WAS SOLD A FEW YEARS AGO. SHAME ON YOU MAPLE MEDIA, YOU RUINED A WONDERFUL APPLICATION. GET READY BECAUSE MORE FREE FEATURES WILL BE PLACES BEHIND A PAYWALL. TYPICAL MAPLE MEDIA. SMH",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,MissSD,"This app know sucks!! I will be looking for another app to use. As usual greed took over and they are changing for basic functions. One of the main reasons I used this app was for the ability to send delayed messages. Its bad enough they don't save your messages so that if you get a new phone the messages automatically transfer, but I'd made peace with that.... But these updates are just unnecessary typical greed. Gosh I knew it was too good good to be true. ðŸ™„ Another one bites the dust! âœŒï¸",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,NASIR Ziauddin,Very nice,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Norry Messina,"I've used this for a long time but over the last couple of years it has started asking to subscribe more and more often for various features. The most recent is delayed send. I paid to remove ads. Now it wants me to subscribe to use that feature and disabled it. Will be looking for another app. I HATE subscriptions, especially for a feature that does not use their servers, like delayed send. Its just greed. My review stands. There are alternatives Cheaper too. Just as featured.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,T W K,Won't send texts. Receives text. Had a problem with this last year. Then you bug me to buy it.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Christian Miller,"Well, after feeling this app was no longer getting love (RCS) I switched to Google Messages. While they auto filter spam messages, they don't clean up old messages nor 2FA like they say they do.... So I'm back to Pulse. While others are complaining about paying for updates, I became a lifetime subscriber years ago.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Todd Glauser,"Great app. Love it. Update 2023. This used to be 5* for me but I when I switched phones I lost many of my messages. If I uninstalled and reinstalled messages came back for the last person i texted. This was tedious and last two times i did this, it didn't work and actually reverted. Had to go to a different app.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Evagelos Tsoulos,"I enjoyed the app for a long time, but they recently limited how many delayed sends you can use per day. Once you ran out, you would be prompted to pay for the premium version. Since that was my default setting, this popped up everyday. That, and the annoying iPhone users with their ""so and so liked an image"" texts are the reasons I switched to a different text app.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Tailor Jai,nice app,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Brandon Sylve,"This app used to be great, but has now begun locking more and more features behind a paywall for their subscription service. A subscription to send text messages? No thanks. I'll be looking for another app that doesn't claw back features from its users.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Michael Adey,Scheduling messages is a lifesaver because life sometimes just gets too busy so setting this to send at a later date is awesome. love how easy the app is to use and the private messaging come a in handy too sometimes ðŸ˜‰,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,dancinglikeagirl,"Used for a month untill I realised I was not receiving sms from at least half my contact list? Ttied to trouble shoot it for hours playing with my settings ,even deleted all my old sms as that apprently can cause this with pulse but still not working. Sms works fine when I switch to other apps so its a pulse issue. Its a shame as I loved the interface and features. Another issue is even though I upgraded to the premium version it still prompts me to upgrade even when I'm signed in.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Eric Petro,"One of my favorite parts of the app was delayed sending, but they started limiting the number of times you can do it per day without paying. Besides that the app is just fine. So, easy decision to uninstall since there are so many other options out there.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jonathan Hinekellar,"Using Android. This app is clumsy / inconsistent. For example it suffers from a typical flaw found in most widespread app interfaces, which these companies purchase to build off of; bad scrolling. I sent an SMS image --usually this app auto-scrolls to the bottom of the conversation list, to cue me that the image was sent. This app failed to do this on a certain image send, so I thought the app hadn't sent the image. So I sent the image again and the app did the same confusing thing. Uninst",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,peter â€œballdontly33â€ jacob,"Great the past 2 years! Now, saying bye-bye. I used the ""scheduled text"" feature with no problems! Now u have to pay $20 a year to use a feature I rarely used!",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Karen Kropf,"another update: I love that I can pin important conversations but I'm sad the schedule message option restricted to one per day. Update: love it. Let's me customize notifications now. I love this app EXCEPT that it doesn't send the notifications! It lets me customize them by person as an option, but none are received. Its as if there is a secret ""silent"" setting I can't find. Had to stop using it because I missed so many text alerts. =(",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Tim Laffoon,Pretty cool,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Aakash Nawab,Don't be so greedy. 1 star because of Delay Message option is now for pro version only.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Claritza Arocho,Muy buena,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Shannon Haggarty,Works great on phone and laptop. Registers on my TCL Google TV but will not accept display over current app setting. Otherwise 5*.,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,tom cctomob,"Solid app with shallow learning curve. I almost never use subscription apps, but this one is well worth $20\year. View, receive, and send sms from tablet, phone, & pc. I really suck at tiny little keyboards so being able to use computer is great.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Greg Stevens,I really like it.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Michael G,Overall app functions well but not extras on the free version and they now charge if you want to schedule texts or delay sending on more than 10 texts per day.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,EDWARD,Thank you so much for resolving this problem and retrieve my lifetime license,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Carson Barry,"The schedule message function, which is fully executed locally on my device and uses no servers or anything that should induce an added cost to the developer, is now a paid feature. If it is *not* executed locally, that is even worse and I am left to pity the devs that had to implement it.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Nicky Thompson,It was nice until I needed to start paying for features I've already been using for years on the free version,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Thomas Autry,"Very nice sms app. I've used a lot of them and this is the one that i have settled on. After several years, I STILL think this is the best one. I love the fact that you can schedule messages to be sent in the future or to be sent at regular intervals. Also, there's a web interface so you can send/receive messages from your browser. This is the text app you have been looking for.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Caleb Wade,Be ready to pay for texting. This app charges for every additional feature that's free on other apps.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Tim Schmoker,Beaks notifications. Everything works great for a few days and then all my notification sounds on my device stop working. Uninstall the app and they work again. Reinstall and after a few days everything is broken again.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Mike Mullins,"Was a five star app. They just put a limit on delayed send, forcing users to upgrade to the paid version. In reality this move will just drive users, myself included, to find other text messaging solutions.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Adam Branson,Demanding money for features of the app after an update. I will look for a new app.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,J P,Exactly what I was looking for. Works perfectly with my Android. But lowering my rating to 3.5 stars since I receive so many duplicate messages. Wish there was a fix for it?!,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Sherry L Moon,"Up until this last update, I have LOVED this app. Now suddenly you've decided to charge for every little thing. Delayed message sending, scheduled message limits, etc. I will be finding a different app.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Matt Leikam,"I've used this app for years and loved it. I originally downloaded it because I could send out texts with a predetermined delay. With the recent update, that feature is now locked behind a paywall. I feel this is just the beginning of locking previously free features behind a pay wall and I want no part of that. I will be switching to a new app.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Superfly Sanchez,"for many months, the app worked well with my Android tablet; however, since an update several months ago it is practically worthless on the tablet. Every ""fix"" the developers suggest does not work. I'm now paying for nothing and being forced to find another tablet texting app.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Devin Ikerd,"Edit: Used to be great, but got bought out and the new owners are charging ridiculous prices for what used to be free features. Do not recommend. Currently looking for a replacement.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Vicki Cudanin,Love the option to create message templates and scheduling.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Joseph Contreras,Slowly moving features to the paid version. At some point there'll be no reason for the free one. Good luck with that.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Apple Id,Excellent app. Best for messaging you can also scheduled to send a message,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Blake Moody,"They're beginning to paywall features that were previously free (delayed messages, schduled messages). Use something like Signal, it's open source and free.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Kathy K,"Very reliable with lots of nice features. Have been using this for a couple of years now UPDATE 2/27/23: Since most recent update, buggy for private messages. I don't have a passcode on mine nor do I want one. But if I want to look at my private messages, I keep getting prompted to enter a passcode. Then I hit enter for no passcode but it doesn't take me into private messages. Works on 2nd try. VERY ANNOYING",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,J M,Great sms with great features and customization.,5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Michael Nocera,"Send delay is now a paid option. Customer service has not responded to my emails regarding an issue. Time to delete, I'm assuming people will follow.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Glenn,"I love this app. I've never had the issues I read in other reviews. I'm probably a basic user just texting to family and friends, but I have used the schedule text option several times with no trouble at all. I do get an occasional request for the plus service, but compared to other free apps, that's not even an issue here. Great app.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,David Bann,This app is decent but I wish it had more functionality I would like to be able to reply directly to specific text messages,3

xyz.klinker.messenger,Mukibi Jonathon,Good,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Robert Kachroo,"Update: Reduced to two stars. While it's a great platform, it seems like there is a push to subscribe. Latest is you only get one daily scheduled message allowance. Assuming more core features will face the same fate. I get why but for my needs going back to Google Messages, Chomp, or Textra.",2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Quackz,"Was a great app, but now they are charging for simple features that have been free for quite some time. If you're looking for an SMS app, look somewhere else. Pulse is no longer worth considering.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Geo Kidd,"The only reason for which I was using this app, was for it's sms scheduler function. Unfortunately, this was just limited to just a single sms / day, which turned the app to a useless app. It's a shame. Uninstalled it.

xyz.klinker.messenger,Kevin Stringer,They are now saying delayed massages is a new feature yet it has had it as long as I have been using it. Now they've made that feature premium only. They didn't even change anything. At least add a custom amount of time or something to say it is new.,3

xyz.klinker.messenger,Courtney Crittendon,Good app overall but now all of a sudden I'm not getting texts that people are sending me!! Wth?!,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Taylor smith,This app used to be good. In fact I bought a lifetime license. Thought I'd go back to it since signal is dropping sms. Can't log in. I simultaneously don't and do have an account. And instead of paying the 10$ lifetime I'm now being forced to buy a lifetime for 99$ on a new account. Garbage app and I'm not going to buy something way overpriced I bought years ago. Go find another app. It's not and never will be worth 99$. That's from someone that used the buggy thing for years.,1

Today I tried to use it on my desktop like normal but it said my subscription had ended. Odd since I pay monthly but maybe have to re-up it after a year? So did the new subscription, opened the app in my phone and EVERYTHING was gone. All my messages and settings. Support has not responded. Syncing is not working.

xyz.klinker.messenger,Chris Georgeson,This is great. I just wish it was easier to get to some of the settings a bit easier in the UI. I've been using Textra for 7 years and love that UI but the amount of customization with pulse and native browser support made me switch.,4

You get a limit but it used to be free. They want you to upgrade to pulse sms+.

Overall this is a good app, but I can't call it reliable.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jim Clay,"Used to be a great app, but since getting new phones in February, (S21+'s) have been having random issues with mms messages. We thought it was our carrier, but after troubleshooting for a few hours tonight, I tried the default samsung messages app and things started working. We had a ton of expired messages from ""unknown"" of and a couple that weren't expired. Clicked on them and they were my test images that hadn't gone through on Pulse. Missed a lot of messages the last several months.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Zrake Stephens,Everything u wanted in a text app. Paying extra is easy for good features and nice look. Looks and beauty. Double threat. Totally worth it,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Zachary Harriz,"As of September with Android 13 This app is almost rendered useless if you are using 2 numbers on the same device (your old phone + device number) You have to choose a default sms app (I use my main phone for work, and would like to keep separate apps for work/personal) Can't do that anymore without using the website, which you don't get notifications for",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Cherie,"Thank goodness for the free trial. I got this specifically for the auto reply feature since it said that I could choose a keyword to send an auto reply. This would be a huge boon for my work, so I'm not bogged down answering the same questions again and again. Only it didn't work at all despite multiple tries, and all my outgoing messages are starting with 0#. Like ""0# Hey can I call you later"" etc. I would've loved the functionality they promised but unfortunately they're not delivering.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Terri Bourne,Love loveove this app. Loving that I can customize the chats,5

xyz.klinker.messenger,MICHAEL MERRITT,Been using Pulse SMS for years ! LOVE IT !,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,jynn,i love the archive feature of this app. also that when you Blocklist someone there's not a little side folder that holds their messages. also love the scheduling feature. it helps to be able to schedule a message to be sent at a future date (birthdays for instance) that not only keeps you from having to remember but also reminds you once it's sent. great app!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Connie Jo Koch,I've been using Pulse as my primary test app for a couple years now. Love it!,5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Yan G.,Account gets resseted regularly...,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Helmut Adel,"It is a versatile and friendly application with many ways to customize, some features that it does not have would be, split between lines in the conversation list, double tick when the message is delivered, phone number visible in the conversation or chat panel, one thing what I don't like is that ""you"" is visible in the conversation list, I think it's not necessary and it looks ugly",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,jkf,I really like Pulse. I gave it a 3 because I can't use the app on my Samsung gear 3 Frontier watch. For some reason it doesn't take my password. I contacted service and they said it was on their end and they would get back to me when it's fixed. been well over a month and still can't use it on my watch,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Clay Coshatt,a surprisingly clean interface with all the functionality you would expect and then some. it would be five stars but I've had some issues with reliability lately,4

Worked great for a year. Bought new phone and now MMS messages won't send. I contacted support. They emailed me requesting I contact them via email, which I had. I re-sent information on the issue via email but have not received any response. If not resolved soon, I will cancel my subscription entirely.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Nicholas Inoue,Update 9/10/2022 Fixed dual sim issues. It should not have broken with the Android update in the first place. Dual Sim worked before update but it's no longer working along with the other mentioned issues.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Glenn,I've been using Pulse for years now. I find no need to look for others. Pulse does it all including delayed send and scheduled send. Support from the dev the two times I needed advise was quick and accurate. Helps that it looks nice too.,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Rayna Weeden,"My experience before this latest update was phenomenal, but I now no longer have the ablity to switch between active Sim card. I have a eSIM and Physical SIM and swiching between them was flawless but that button to do this is no longer present.",4

xyz.klinker.messenger,Luke Hodgkin,"I've tried almost every app to text from my pc and pulse sms is the best!

xyz.klinker.messenger,Mike Convey,"Update: This app used to be great, but now it's buggy, freezes up, and I can't even read some messages. As a result, I switched to Google Messages. So bummed this app went downhill. I'll miss the labels/folders functionality. Here's my previous review from 12/18/19: Best SMS app period! Fully functioning Web interface. Frequently updated. Google messages added a Web interface, so I tried to switch back, but it just isn't as good as this app. Second to none!! Hoping for RCS soon.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Cyndia Haggard,I now getting TONS of spam text. Why is Pulse not catching these? This is new in the last couple of weeks.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Levana Blankenship,"This app was great up until recently... With the latest update, the ability to change the SIM within the app was removed. The site doesn't even reflect the change. I utilized this application for my business with my dual SIM to avoid having to give out my personal number to clients. It can't even do that anymore so I'll be disputing the charge on my card for the premium version of this app as it no longer does what it advertised.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Levtastec,Was happy with the application until you took away the ability to use the secondary sim. Meaning I can't use my work number to text my employees instead have to use my personal number... Would gladly give five stars. The little SIM button was restored.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Cristian Penel,Since the last update the app did not let me send messages from dual sims. I had to uninstall the app and install a previous version.,4

xyz.klinker.messenger,Gary Prudhomme,great app. love the delayed sending option!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Nicole Lemanski,"Since the update, the widget only goes straight into the whole app and not just the name I tapped on. Makes the widget kind of pointless.

After the most recent update, I stopped receiving notifications for text messages and didn't know why. I've seen others have the same issues.

xyz.klinker.messenger,Brett Lewis,Since the last update it works great. I like being able to customize each contacts notification tone,4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jim Hardwick,Was a five star app until messages started showing up out of order. Then it was again until notifications stopped working after the update in late August 2022. This was the best cross-platform SMS app until Maple Media took over. Time to switch to something else.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Craig Parker,I bought the lifetime app mainly for the 2 sim feature. Latest update has seen this been removed. It's no longer fit for the purpose I bought it for.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Anthony Mahone,I believe it's fixed now You will give it some time and see how it goes.,2

xyz.klinker.messenger,Mike Maloney,Frustrated. I have updated to the newest release and still do not receive notifications. This is why I have rated low.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Matthew Lemmers,"Still absolutely love this app from a functional standpoint, though I have noticed that sometimes notifications have been coming through without sounds or anything since the recent update. Material You update perhaps? I'm aware you can choose to specific color hex from the theme portion. Would love it if this matched the color of the wallpaper. It looks really out of place ever since the Android 12 update though and the dynamic keyboard theme.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jason Reedy,"No notifications. I downloaded this to organize texts for work connections, but if I don't get notifications when messages are incoming then it defeats the entire purpose",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Nancy Waskiewicz,I have been a long time user of pulse for many years now.. A few days ago I stopped getting notifications of new texts. Uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times to no avail.,3
xyz.klinker.messenger,Gilber Garcia,"This app was great when Luke owned it. I trusted in him selling It that it would be handled well. The second to last update broke notifications while creating a mess of bugs. Random glitches like the keyboard minimizing or closing conversations, even closing the app. The kicker was that the update notes stated it was to correct some bugs. I'll continue to use it as a lifetime sub. But man I can jump ship when next I hear something bad. Better not be skimming messages",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Joe,"used to be my favorite messaging app, but its unreliable and the bugs are too severe. it just caused my phone to automatically resend dozens of picture messages to people I havent spoken to in months. This happened after uninstalling, because the notifications stopped making sounds and vibrating despite being turned on in the app and phone settings. Really unacceptable errors.",1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Amanda Ortega,When an app error occurred developers were on it for the patch. Highly appreciated!,5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Gerald Taylor,It keeps closing out on it own. Was a 5 star app before this.,2
xyz.klinker.messenger,Daphne Orr,"UPDATE: Notification error resolved. I really do like the features this app offers over the texting app that comes with my service provider. Love this app, but the update today has caused it to not send me any text notifications. I have to keep constantly opening the app to see if I have any new messages.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,Alex Isabel,Terrible Bug. I used to love this app. Got a lifetime subscription years ago but now it just causes issues. Whenever I uninstall the app and it goes back to my default Samsung messaging app it automatically triggers text messages that get sent out to everyone without my permission. It's terrible I had to factory reset my phone to stop the texts from going out. The issue never happened until I started using Pulse SMS. Also it seems like my old lifetime subscription almost didn't work properly.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Chris Lightoast,"Thank you for your attention, MapleMedia , I appreciate your quick notation. Please keep me posted ! Pulse SMS is my favorite app and was worth the $ for the Extras",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Danielle A,"I downloaded this app because I was experiencing problems with my default app, I wasn't receiving texts. It was working really well until last week when it wouldn't let me know when a text arrived. It was still receiving and sending, but I had to open the app and check before I found out if a text had come. So I had to switch back to my default app which did let me know and now seems to be working. If this can be fixed I'll start using it again as I prefer it.",4
xyz.klinker.messenger,Nancy Brown,Have loved this app for years and more so recently since it was available on new samsung galaxy watch 4.

Log back in, go through captcha a few times, look up how to fix it, and a half hour of frustration later you're good again. Sorry, guys, this is not what I am willing to pay for. This is absolutely unacceptable behavior for a paid subscription app. It's been, what, a year (for me anyway), and you haven't fixed this. Don't ask me to refresh subscription. YOU fix it. Unsubscribed.",1

I tried to see if it needed updating and it didn't, so I unintstalled and reinstalled but it didn't fix the problem. Upon reinstalling it, it resent some old texts from like months ago for whatever reason.

xyz.klinker.messenger,Bill Storck,This app was great. Now messages have not gone through at times and I'm not getting notifications by sound or how many. This is unacceptable!!! I recently paid for this app and need to get a refund. This is my main form of communication with my family and work.

xyz.klinker.messenger,Lonnie Marie,Love it. Been working great for me. Not sure where all the negative reviews are from but I haven't had any issues.

From no notifications to the app closing as soon as I open it to see if I do have a text to text messages appearing hours later. I would say purchase but not at this point.,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Michael Zarfl,"Worked well. Until it didn't. Just stopped audible notifications out of the blue.

Conversations missing some texts. Honestly it is a buggy mess that keeps loading ads for its subscription service LOL bought it once before. Had nothing but problems.

I'm not using the free version,3

xyz.klinker.messenger,tony d.,"Purchased this app based on features, but it was a complete waste. * Group messages are NEVER sent * When replying to group messages, NEVER sent either * It is near impossible to get a straight answer from author; all emails are auto-replies with same troubleshoot message. * Small images aren't recv'd, even below 1MB. * Msgs show as ""sent"" on my phone, but receipient does not receive. Running Android 11 on One+ 5T. Developer never reached out, even after noticeable 1 star review.",1

xyz.klinker.messenger,Locke Leverette,"I was a long time chomp sms user, and now I've switched to Pulse. It's much faster, very snappy. Decently organized. More customization options would be nice as far as UI and such, but the basics are there and work well. I enjoy the auto suggest feature.",5

xyz.klinker.messenger,Orlando Carrasquillo,Almost a month witthout a resolution! Horrible customer service. I have been trying to correct an issue with my account that is preventing me from being able to use multiple devices to text. This is the primary reason why I said for the year subscription. I tried everything that the customer SVC team recommended via email but nothing has worked so far. I have also requested multiple time for a number to call so that I can speak to a human being but my requests have basically been ignored,1
xyz.klinker.messenger,Jani â€œrobsku Janegirlâ€ Saksa,"It's ok, if you want an easy simple SMS application that let's you access your messages from any computer with browser, read and send them remotely from there for a small monthly or yearly fee (or one time lifetime fee for slightly larger price). However for myself Pulse offered too little and I went back to Textra which has features I've come to rely on - and accessing my messages from a PC would be nice, but not that important. It's all about what you want though, might be perfect for others.",3
xyz.klinker.messenger,1-Way Direct LLC,Love it for the use of handling business on other devices other than my personal. Im only giving 3 stars because the interface could be better. I should be able to log into pulse from another android phone which am not able but it says ANY DEVICE.,3

xyz.klinker.messenger,Douglas German,"Overall it's a very good app. With minor fine-tuning, it's pleasing to the eye. The only problem I see so far is it will trash an outbound video attachment with over-compression, but an inbound video is fine, at least with using a .mov file. To override send without delay is cumbersome. All the rest I like. Feedback explained. Upped rating.",5
xyz.klinker.messenger,baraka dubs,No more worries about the sms apps when we've got this one now. The app is well designed and has everything to set for the best messages app.eeeh the best part of it for me is how you can set to delay messages something hard to find elsewhere .

xyz.klinker.messenger,Eli Cutchen,"It's a pretty decent texting app. It offers a lot of customization like colors and other aesthetics. One reason why I switched from Verizon's Messages+ app, was because it allows you to name your group messages (something you can only do when creating group messages in Messages+). Also, you can customize each group message individually. You can set a ringtone specifically to the group, rather than setting that ringtone to each individual recipient. Overall, pretty happy with it!",4

The control is that I didn't have the same issues using Google's native app on the same networks. Notifications also fell short for me with Pulse.

xyz.klinker.messenger,Michael Stakelum,Unistalling app now as it continues to make life more difficult. When I send a message to an automated system the system can't recognise the message.
