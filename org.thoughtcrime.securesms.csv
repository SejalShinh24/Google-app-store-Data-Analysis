org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Andrew McCardle,"Every phone supports sms, I wouldn't care if it was a paid feature, I'd throw in money for that. The only reason I'd use it now is if I **needed** secure communication, which let's face it, I don't. If I'm contacting customers I can't ask them to download Signal for the odd time I need to contact them so it forces me to maintain multiple apps and communication platforms. That's one of the reasons I don't want to use fb messenger and WhatsApp also. Without this feature, I cannot continue to use.",2

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,EvaEva,Perfect,5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Aoi Green,With the fact that you're ditching SMS text messaging makes me no longer want to use Signal and for now on I will only use aTox / proTox also known as Tox chat. By dropping SMS you've made it harder for me to convince people to use this app. So I have switched over to an app for SMS called Silence. It has SMS encryption capabilities I only use the signal to send messages to my signal desktop user. I do not use signal to communicate with others that is how useless you've made this app!!!,1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Darmansyah Tanjung,Ok very good,5

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Johnny,Removal of sms support is a shame. Was a stand out; now an also-ran message app with limited use. Pile on with delayed delivery of messages from what little contacts I have left that use Signal.,2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Baharul Islam,I was bragging about Signal infront of my friends for it's privacy but in the end they severely beat me with few features that aren't available on Signal: 1.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Jon Anderson - Ferrell,By dropping sms support they killed any and all functionality. I'm not going to keep a separate app on my phone for the 4 people who didn't delete their account.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Douglas Calkins,"Would be really good app jf they didn't require your phone number . Doesn't make sense that this is promoted as the most secure app but yet they can literally have all of your and I mean all if your info with just your phone number that's connected to your emails, phone plan, passwords, financial information, your activity, your personal information etc. All you have to do is 100% completely trust any and everyone who works for/with signal with all of your information attached to your number NO",2

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Jj,"Signal used to be the best SMS messaging service available until recently. Now it only works If other people have Signal. Before the change, If one of your contacts did not have signal, The program would still work but it would send unencrypted messages to those recipients, which was perfectly fine with me.. So now the greatest Messaging program is no longer useful to me And I am stuck using the junk Samsung default messenger. FU Signal",1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,rk ml,Very unhappy that SMS is removed from this app. I was happy to have 1 less messaging application by SMS and Signal being in one application. Now I have to use 2 different apps. ACTUALLY SWITCHING TO Google Messages as it supports End to End Encryption so no more Signal for me. Going back to basics...

Functionally it was second to none, also it's the only point to point encrypted messaging that I know of. If you care about digital privacy, this is the app for you. Today, for completely nonsense reasons, they stopped supporting sms which means most of the dozens of people I've gotten to use the app will now go back to some other awful sms app. Terrible decision and I will hate it until the reverse course.",1

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Brandon Hernandez,"The best messaging app for android, period. It respects your privacy, and it never fails me.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Vicious6,Great app if you don'want the world knowing your personal business. Endosed by Edward Snowden himself. That should say it all! * Well it has been quite sometime now. My opinions have not changed. As the net gets more dangerous everyday I still feel that Signal is your best option as far as any messaging app that you can used. I only wish it could still be used as an all-in-one (as it used to be an SMS spp as well). But I am sure Signal has their reasons for making that decision.,5
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Dwonn Giesbrecht,Was great till they canceled the sms texting,1
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,A Google user,"Excellent for security and ease of use. Unfortunately here in early 2023 the devs went too far off the ideological deep end and alienated tons of users by removing SMS support instead of clearly marking which messages are and are not secure. So now you'll need a totally separate app for normal texts, as this only works with special encrypted Signal texts.",2
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Killian â€œDawn Breakerâ€,Good for secure messaging. Terrible that they dropped handling standard text messages. 2 areas of improvement. Bring back text support. Have an option to actually send the text after X seconds so the sender could catch a typo.,3

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Chris D,"Bring back SMS support. My wife and kids, and some friends, were happily using Signal as their messaging app. Now it doesn't support SMS, using a seperate app for SMS is too much hassle for them, so they've gone back to SMS for everything and dropped Signal. Some services - banking, government logins - send SMS codes for login. There's no option to use signal. If these people can't receive these messages in the same app, they won't use signal.",2

When a user uninstalls/reinstalls the app, it deletes the history without confirming with the user if they want to keep it.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Trevor Dowe,Loss of SMS support was a bad decision and made the app worthless to me as only a handful of contacts also used it. It's a shame because this has been my default app since it launched way back when red phone was its companion for phone calls. If I could I'd give it zero stars for this asinine reduction in user function,1

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,Jean,"I used to love this app and would of given it a 4 or 5 star review before they discontinued the SMS feature, which used to make it an excellent all round messaging app. While signal messaging is secure, you can only use it if your contact has also signed up for the app. And most people haven't. So it's rendered fairly useless most of the time. I'll keep it for a little while longer for the whole 4 people I know that's stayed with Signal. Everyone else I know left when SMS stopped.",1
